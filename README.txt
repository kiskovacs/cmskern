A simple web content-management framework based on JSON schema 
(http://json-schema.org/) definition. The forms are dynamically 
generated using AngularJS (http://angularjs.org/) and with some
knowledge of the Play! Framework it should be fairly straight 
forward to customize this app to your specific needs.


cmskern requires:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) SE 6+
* Play! Framework 1.2.4
* MongoDB (as back-end JSON store)
